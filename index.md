Addon | Function
------------ | -------------
AG Unit Frames | Lightweight unit frames.
Aloft Plates | Creates nice and minimalistic overhead plates, but Tidy Plates has certain features this does not.
AF + Arena Frames Improved | This addon was saved over from the AT forums.
Auto Screenshot | Screenshots at interval set by user. Great for keeping a log of leveling or arena matches.
Bagnon | Combines all your bags into one and allows you to search for items by name.
Bartender | Allows you to easily customize your action bars. Using Dominos you can clone characters in conjuction with Action Bar Saver.
bChat | Works in combination with Prat to clear away clutter.
Bind Pad | If you never want to worry about keybinding again this is really nice way to tackle the problem. Allows you to create more macros than the default UI allows. Make sure you do not use the same name for regular macros and Bindpad macros.
Buffet | Great for mages. It creates a macro that utilizes the best items for mana and health. For example if you have arena water and mage food it would use the mage food instead and if you are out of mage food it uses arena water.
Button Facade | Allows for important keybinding visual customization.
Capping | Arena countdown and essential battleground information.
Castbars| Requires very little configuration and is lightweight.

Dispel Border | Essential for Ele Shaman and Disc Priest. Highlights removable buffs.
Dominos | Recommended action bar addon. Perfect in combination with Action Bar Saver.

Elite Player Frame Enhanced | Ego booster and a nice addition.
Event Alert | Informs you of certain procs and their duration.
Friend & Ignore Share | Syncs friends across multiple characters.
Gear Score Lite | Allows you to easily understand the quality of each piece of gear you have as well as a summary for your character.
Gladius | One of the most fundamental addons for arena gameplay. It displays if trinkets have been used, announces if enemy players are drinking and detects the talent spec of other players.
Grid Healing Frames | Very customizeable and solid healing unit frames.
Heal Bot | Very functional and customizeable healing frames. An excellent alternate to Grid but isn't as intimidatingly complex as Vuhdo.
Hide Chat Button | If you miss this addon then use Prat and bChat and create a new message window with all the various chats unchecked. I'll be making a tutorial for this process.
In Combat Indicator | Constantly displays your combat status.
Interrupt Bar | Lists the cooldowns of enemies interrupt abilities.
Koko Stomp Alert | Essential for Tremor Totem reminders. Can be used for any totem.

Snowfall Key Press | Immediate spell activation, can shave off 20ms or more. You have to add all the keys of your keyboard to the list of its keydown spells or this addon won't work properly.
Sound Alerter | A very different type of addon. It announces important spells by name as soon as they are casted.
Speedy Actions | Activates spells when you press down a key instead of releasing it.
Spell Alerter | Paladin's Divine Shield or offensive buffs like Bloodlust can be displayed with this addon. It can also let you know when you are being Mana Burned or if a mage has used Presence of Mind.
